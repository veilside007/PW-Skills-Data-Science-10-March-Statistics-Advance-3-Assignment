    "Q1: What is Estimation Statistics? Explain point estimate and interval estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Estimation statistics is a branch of statistics concerned with estimating population parameters based on sample data. It involves using sample statistics to make educated guesses about the true values of parameters in the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Point Estimate**: A point estimate is a single value (or point) used to approximate a population parameter. It's typically derived from sample data and serves as the best guess for the parameter's value. For example, if you're estimating the mean height of a population based on a sample, the sample mean would be the point estimate for the population mean height.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Interval Estimate**: An interval estimate provides a range of values within which the population parameter is likely to lie. Unlike point estimates, which give only a single value, interval estimates offer a range of plausible values. Confidence intervals are a common type of interval estimate. For instance, if you calculate a 95% confidence interval for the population mean height, it might be stated as \"We are 95% confident that the true population mean height lies between X and Y.\" The interval (X, Y) provides a range of values where we believe the population parameter is likely to be found."

    "Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to make inferences about a population parameter based on sample data. It involves formulating two competing hypotheses: the null hypothesis (H0) and the alternative hypothesis (H1). The null hypothesis typically represents the status quo or a statement of no effect, while the alternative hypothesis represents what the researcher is trying to prove.\n",

    "The process of hypothesis testing involves:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Formulating hypotheses**: Define the null and alternative hypotheses based on the research question.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Interpretation**:\n",
    "   - A small p-value (typically less than the chosen significance level, α) indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis. It suggests that the observed data are unlikely to have occurred under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true.\n",
    "   - A large p-value suggests weak evidence against the null hypothesis. It indicates that the observed data are reasonably likely to occur if the null hypothesis is true.\n",

    "2. **Decision Rule**:\n",
    "   - In hypothesis testing, if the p-value is less than or equal to the chosen significance level (α), typically 0.05, then the null hypothesis is rejected. This implies that the observed results are statistically significant, and there is evidence to support the alternative hypothesis.\n",
    "   - Conversely, if the p-value is greater than the significance level, then the null hypothesis is not rejected. This suggests that the observed results are not statistically significant, and there is insufficient evidence to support the alternative hypothesis.\n",

    "   - The p-value allows researchers to directly assess the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis relative to the chosen significance level. For example, if the p-value is 0.02 (less than 0.05), it means that there is strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis at the 0.05 significance level.\n",

    "4. **Effect Size**:\n",
    "   - While the p-value informs about the statistical significance of the results, it does not provide information about the practical significance or the magnitude of the effect observed. Even a small effect size can yield a significant p-value with a large enough sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Contextual Interpretation**:\n",
    "   - It's important to interpret the p-value within the context of the specific research question, the study design, and the practical implications of the findings. A significant p-value does not necessarily imply importance or relevance in all contexts."

    "Q11: What is Student’s t distribution? When to use the t-Distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Student's t-distribution, often simply referred to as the t-distribution, is a probability distribution that arises in hypothesis testing when the sample size is small and/or the population standard deviation is unknown. It is named after William Sealy Gosset, who developed the distribution under the pseudonym \"Student\" while working at the Guinness Brewery in Dublin.\n",
    "\n",
    "The t-distribution is similar in shape to the standard normal distribution (bell-shaped curve), but it has heavier tails. As the sample size increases, the t-distribution approaches the normal distribution. The shape of the t-distribution is determined by its degrees of freedom, which are typically equal to the sample size minus one.\n",

    "### When to Use the t-Distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Small Sample Sizes**:\n",
    "   - When dealing with small sample sizes (typically n < 30), the population standard deviation is often unknown, making the use of the normal distribution inappropriate. In such cases, the t-distribution is used to account for the increased uncertainty associated with estimating the population standard deviation from a small sample.\n",
